Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the basic steps involved in package development in Python:

1. Create a directory for your package.
2. Create an __init__.py file in the directory.
3. Create the modules that you want to include in your package.
4. Create a setup.py file to define your package.
5. Distribute your package using a package manager.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each step:

1. Create a directory for your package.

The first step is to create a directory for your package. This directory will contain all of the files that make up your package, including the __init__.py file, the modules, and the setup.py file.

2. Create an __init__.py file in the directory.

The __init__.py file is a special file that tells Python that the directory is a Python package. This file can be empty, but it is often used to define variables and functions that are shared by all of the modules in the package.

3. Create the modules that you want to include in your package.

The next step is to create the modules that you want to include in your package. A module is a Python file that contains a collection of functions and classes. To create a module, simply create a file with the .py extension.

4. Create a setup.py file to define your package.

The setup.py file is a Python file that is used to define your package. This file tells Python what the name of your package is, what modules it contains, and how to install it.

5. Distribute your package using a package manager.

Once you have created your package, you can distribute it using a package manager. A package manager is a tool that helps you to install and manage Python packages. The most popular package manager for Python is pip.

To install your package using pip, you can use the following command:

```
pip install your_package_name
```
