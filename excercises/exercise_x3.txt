Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the steps on how to document code in packages or modules in Python:

1. Use docstrings.

Docstrings are a way to document Python code. They are strings that are placed at the beginning of a module, function, class, or method. Docstrings can be used to describe the purpose of the code, its usage, and its limitations.

To create a docstring, simply use the triple quotes (""") to enclose the text of the docstring. The docstring can be multi-line and can include formatting such as headings, bold text, and italics.

Here is an example of a docstring for a function:

```
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculates the factorial of a number.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of n.
    """

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

2. Use the Sphinx documentation system.

Sphinx is a documentation system that can be used to generate documentation for Python packages. Sphinx can be used to create a variety of documentation formats, including HTML, PDF, and EPUB.

To use Sphinx to document your Python code, you will need to create a `conf.py` file in the root directory of your package. This file will tell Sphinx how to generate the documentation.

You can then create documentation files for your modules and functions. These files can be written in reStructuredText, which is a markup language that is easy to read and write.

Sphinx has a number of tools that can help you to document your Python code. For example, you can use the `autodoc` extension to automatically generate documentation for your modules and functions.

For more information on documenting Python code with Sphinx, you can refer to the following resources:

* The Sphinx documentation: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
* The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python: https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/documentation/

I hope this helps!

Here are some additional tips for documenting Python code:

* Be clear and concise.
* Use keywords that will help people find your documentation.
* Use examples to illustrate your points.
* Keep your documentation up-to-date.
