Sure, here are the basic structures of HTML and JSON data:

**HTML**

The basic structure of an HTML document is as follows:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is my page</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag tells the browser that the document is an HTML document. The `<html>` tag marks the beginning of the HTML document. The `<head>` tag contains the metadata for the document, such as the title. The `<body>` tag contains the content of the document.

HTML elements are enclosed in tags. The opening tag defines the element, and the closing tag closes the element. For example, the `<h1>` tag defines a heading, and the `</h1>` tag closes the heading.

HTML attributes are used to provide additional information about an element. For example, the `title` attribute of the `<html>` tag specifies the title of the document.

**JSON**

The basic structure of JSON data is as follows:

```
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30
}
```

A JSON object is enclosed in curly braces (`{` and `}`). The key-value pairs are separated by commas. The key is a string, and the value can be a string, a number, an array, or another object.

Arrays are enclosed in square brackets (`[` and `]`). The elements of an array are separated by commas.
