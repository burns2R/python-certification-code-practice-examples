what are the basics of Perform different types of data validation tasks (e.g. consistency, constraints, range
validation, uniqueness) in pandas

Sure, here are some of the basic statements to perform different types of data validation tasks using pandas:

**Consistency:**

* To check if all of the values in a column are of the same type, you can use the `dtype` attribute of the DataFrame. For example, the following code checks if all of the values in the `age` column are integers:

```python
df['age'].dtype == int
```

* To check if all of the values in a column are unique, you can use the `unique()` method of the DataFrame. For example, the following code checks if all of the values in the `email` column are unique:

```python
df['email'].unique()
```

**Constraints:**

* To check if the values in a column are within a certain range, you can use the `between()` method of the Series. For example, the following code checks if the values in the `age` column are between 0 and 100:

```python
df['age'].between(0, 100)
```

**Range validation:**

* To check if the values in a column fall within a certain range, you can use the `isin()` method of the Series. For example, the following code checks if the values in the `age` column are within the range of 18 to 65:

```python
df['age'].isin(range(18, 66))
```

**Uniqueness:**

* To check if each value in a column is unique, you can use the `unique()` method of the DataFrame. For example, the following code checks if each email address in the `email` column is unique:

```python
df['email'].unique()
```
