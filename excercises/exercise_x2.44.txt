You joined a new data engineering team working on the same repository for a data pipeline.
You are informed that:

• All changes are directly committed to the main branch
• The pipeline is built and deployed from that main branch.

What is a disadvantage of relying on a single branch in this strategy?
 Options:
It can delay development due to a centralized code review process.
It can make it harder to track changes made to the project.
It can add conflicts between different teams working on the project.
-->It can make it harder to catch errors before the production environment. <---

This is because any change to the main branch could potentially introduce a new bug into the pipeline code. This can make it difficult to debug and fix pipeline failures before they affect production.
The other options are not necessarily true:
A centralized code review process can help to improve the quality of the code, but it is not a requirement for using a single branch.
It is possible to track changes made to the project even if all changes are committed to the main branch.
Conflicts between different teams can occur regardless of the branching strategy being used.
Overall, the biggest disadvantage of relying on a single branch for a data pipeline is that it can make it harder to catch errors before they affect production.
